# üìä Project Manager System

A **microservice-based Project Management System** designed to help teams efficiently manage projects, tasks, and collaboration in real-time. The system supports **modular project management, task tracking, Git integration, notifications**, and visualizations via **Kanban** and **Calendar** views.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This platform leverages a **modern microservices architecture** with **Dockerized backend services** and asynchronous communication via **Apache Kafka**.  

Key features include:  
- **Project creation and modular breakdown**  
- **Task, epic, bug, subtask, and story management**  
- **Git commit tracking and Calendar views**  
- **Account recovery via email (handled by User-Service)**  
- **Real-time notifications and comments**  
- **Secure JWT-based authentication with Spring Security**  
- **Spring Profiles for development and Docker environments**  

Users can **organize projects into modules, epics, stories, and tasks**, assign team members, set deadlines, and track progress efficiently.

## üõ† Features

### User & Project Management
- Create projects and manage only **project-level details** (Project-Service).  
- Assign team members and watch members to tasks (managed by Task-Service).  
- **Account recovery via email** provided by User-Service.  

### Task, Epic, Subtask, Story & Bug Management
- Task-Service handles **tasks, subtasks, epics, stories, and bugs**.  
- Track task lifecycle, assign deadlines, and update statuses.  
- Move tasks across stages with **SAGA pattern for transactional consistency**.  

### Activity & Collaboration
- Activity-Tracker logs **user activities, Git commits, and project interactions**.  
- Provides **Calendar view** for task and commit tracking.  
- Real-time **comments and collaboration** on tasks.  

### Notifications & Communication
- **GraphQL subscriptions** for in-app notifications.  
- **Email notifications** using Thymeleaf templates for important updates.  

### Security & Performance
- **Spring Security** with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.  
- Redis for **session management and caching**.  
- Asynchronous communication via **Apache Kafka**.  
- **Spring Profiles**: `dev` for local development and `docker` for containerized backend deployments.

## üì¶ Backend Deployment (Dockerized)

All **backend services** are Dockerized and orchestrated via Docker Compose. The **frontend is not yet dockerized**, so it should be run locally with Node.js during development.  

```bash
# Build and start all backend services using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
